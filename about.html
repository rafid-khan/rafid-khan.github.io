                My name is Rafid Khan. I was born and raised in New York City, and have
                been inspired by the plethora of innovative, and talented residents here to help 
                generate and develop impactful solutions for the world.

                Currently, I'm a 3rd year student studying Computer Science, and Applied Mathematics 
                at the Rochester Institute of Technology. I'm deeply interested in programming and finance, 
                and am currently seeking co-op / internship opportunities. I'm proficient in 
                C++, Java, and Python, and always pursuing to expand my horizons. Feel free to take a look
                at my projects, or my resume. You can get in touch with me through <a href="https://www.linkedin.com">linkedin.</a>
